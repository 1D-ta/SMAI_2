Second SMAI Project by Suhani Jain and Vandita Lodha for the course **Search Methods in Artificial Intelligence** by Deepak Khemani

### Our approach to solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) combines two heuristic methods:
- Nearest Neighbor Algorithm
- 2-opt Optimization

#### Running instructions for shell:
1. run file run.sh
2. this calls tsp_solver.py
3. syntax: ./run.sh < input_file.txt
4. do chmod +x run.sh before prev command for 1st time
