# SMAI Assignment 2
# Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) Report
### By Vandita Lodha and Suhani Jain

## Approach

Our approach to solving the TSP combines two heuristic methods:
1. Nearest Neighbor Algorithm
2. 2-opt Optimization

### Nearest Neighbor Algorithm

The Nearest Neighbor algorithm is used to generate an initial tour. It works as follows:

1. Start with an arbitrary city
2. Find the nearest unvisited city and add it to the tour
3. Repeat step 2 until all cities are visited

This method provides a quick, albeit suboptimal, solution to the TSP.

### 2-opt Optimization

To improve upon the initial tour generated by the Nearest Neighbor algorithm, we apply the 2-opt optimization technique. This method iteratively improves the tour by:

1. Considering all possible pairs of edges in the current tour
2. Swapping these edges if it results in a shorter tour
3. Repeating until no further improvements can be made

## Implementation
1. **Data Structures**: 
   - Cities are represented as complex numbers for easy Euclidean distance calculation
   - Tours are represented as lists of cities

2. **Key Functions**:
   - `nearest_neighbor`: Implements the Nearest Neighbor algorithm
   - `opt2`: Implements the 2-opt optimization
   - `rep_opt2_nearest_tsp`: Combines Nearest Neighbor and 2-opt, running multiple times with different starting cities

3. **Input Handling**:
   - The program can handle both Euclidean and non-Euclidean TSP instances
   - For non-Euclidean cases, the distance matrix is used

4. **Output**:
   - The program outputs the best tour found in the required format (zero-based city indices)

## Conclusion

The implemented solution provides a balance between solution quality and computational efficiency. By combining the quick initial tour generation of Nearest Neighbor with the improvement capabilities of 2-opt, we achieve reasonably good tours within the given time constraints. Our future work would focus on implementing methods to ensure further path optimisation.
